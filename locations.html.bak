                The Galle Fort, or Dutch Fort as it is also known, is a fortification first built by the Portuguese on the Southwestern coast of Sri Lanka. The initial fortifications, which were built in the late 16th century, were quite basic. However, the fort underwent extensive modifications in the 17th century by the Dutch, making it one of the most important archeological, architectural and historic monuments to illustrate the European influence in South East Asia between the 16th and 19th centuries.

                A natural wonder in the middle of a rocky cliff, Hummanaya Blow Hole shoots seawater in the air with a loud whooshing audible from far away. Reputedly the second-largest blowhole in the world, this geyser-like spout can sometimes reach 30 m (100 ft). Snap pictures of the spray against a background of cliffs and the blue-green expanse of water. Onsite facilities include a tiny museum on marine life, restrooms, parking, food, drinks, and souvenirs. The hole blows year-round, but its force varies.
